# Rancher UX Repository

Welcome to the **Rancher UX Repository**!

This repository serves as the **central location for product design** for the **Enterprise Container Management platform**. 

## Purpose

The Rancher UX repository is a collaborative hub for creating and refining the user experience for Rancher's products. 


## How to Write Effective Task Descriptions and Manage Issues ##

1. **Create a Clear Title**

   The title is essential, as it provides a snapshot of the work you’re requesting.

   - **[Action] + [Problem] + [Context] + [What]**
     - **[Action]**: Describe the type of work needed, such as a fix, update, new feature, or component.
     - **[Problem]**: Explain what needs fixing or updating. Is something broken, outdated, or misaligned?
     - **[Context]**: Specify where in the product this component lives (e.g., which page or section).
     - **[What]**: State exactly what you're requesting. Is it a front-end component or back-end functionality? (e.g., a new modal, form, conditional logic, or content update).

2. **Organize and Assign Issues**

   Add tags to issues for easy scanning and prioritization.

3. **Structure Your Content**

   - **Problem & Opportunity**: Describe the problem or the feature you're requesting. Explain its benefit to the end-user experience and overall value (to the user, team, or product). Some designers and project managers use a “jobs to be done” sentence structure.
   - **Context or Steps to Reproduce**: Provide instructions on navigating to the bug or component to help others test it and understand the context.
   - **Checklist** (if applicable): List specific items that developers need to build or fix. This helps track progress by showing what’s been completed and what’s left.
   - **Images, GIFs, or Videos**: Include screenshots, mock-ups, or GIFs when relevant. Visuals can communicate far more efficiently than detailed descriptions and save time.
   - **Relevant Links**: For new features, include any relevant links, such as cross-links to related GitHub issues or pull requests.

4. **Ping Teammates**

   Mention team members (@ + name) to request additional information or bring their attention to an issue.

1. Write a clear title

The title is critical because it’s a snapshot of the work you’re asking us to undertake.

    [Action] + [Problem] + [Context] + [What]

    The [Action] describes what kind of work you’re asking for. eg. A fix, an update, an additional feature, a new component, etc.
    The Problem explains what’s broken (if applicable) eg. is something misaligned, is the content outdated etc.
    The [Context] points to where that component lives within your product (eg. what page or section would that code apply to?)
    The [What] shows exactly what you’re asking for. Is it a front-end component, or back-end functionality? (eg. a new modal, a new form, some conditional logic, a content update etc.)


2. Organize and assign issues

You can also create and add tags to issues to make it even easier for us to scan and prioritize. 



3. Structure your Content

Problem & Opportunity: What is the problem that needs to be solved, or feature you’re requesting be built— and how does that benefit the end user experience. Basically, why is this worth time and effort, and what is the overall value it will add (to the user, to the team, to the product etc.) I’ve seen some designers and project managers write this as in a jobs to be done sentence structure.
Context or steps to reproduce: How can someone else quickly navigate to the place where you found this bug or component (or where you want this feature to be built), so that they can test it themselves and/or get more context.
Checklist (if the work involves multiple elements): What are the specific pieces you’re asking devs to build or fix. List them out so they don’t get lost, and keep that list at the top so you can come back to this issue and quickly see what items are checked-off, and what remains to be done.
Images, GIFs, or Videos: Upload relevant screenshots, mock-ups, or GIFs whenever you can. A picture is always worth a thousand-billion-trillion words! If you can show precisely what you want to draw attention to, it will save you time writing detailed descriptions, and will save time reading and interpreting that! Images can be drag+dropped into the issue in two seconds— it’s so fast there’s no excuse not to include visuals when they’re relevant.
Relevant links: If it’s a new feature, include any relevant  links or information. Or you might want to cross-link this issue to existing GitHub issues or pull-requests that are relevant
4. Ping teammates

Mention others who are involved (@ + name) to request extra information or draw someone's attention to an issue.
