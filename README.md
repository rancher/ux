# Rancher UX Repository

Welcome to the **Rancher UX Repository**!

This repository serves as the **central location for product design** for the **Enterprise Container Management platform**. 

## Purpose

The Rancher UX repository is a collaborative hub for creating and refining the user experience for Rancher's products. 


## How to Write Effective Task Descriptions and Manage Issues ##

1. **Create a Clear Title**

   The title is essential, as it provides a snapshot of the work you’re requesting.

   - **[Action] + [Problem] + [Context] + [What]**
     - **[Action]**: Describe the type of work needed, such as a fix, update, new feature, or component.
     - **[Problem]**: Explain what needs fixing or updating. Is something broken, outdated, or misaligned?
     - **[Context]**: Specify where in the product this component lives (e.g., which page or section).
     - **[What]**: State exactly what you're requesting. Is it a front-end component or back-end functionality? (e.g., a new modal, form, conditional logic, or content update).

2. **Organize and Assign Issues**

   Add tags to issues for easy scanning and prioritization.

3. **Structure Your Content**

   - **Problem & Opportunity**: Describe the problem or the feature you're requesting. Explain its benefit to the end-user experience and overall value (to the user, team, or product). Some designers and project managers use a “jobs to be done” sentence structure.
   - **Context or Steps to Reproduce**: Provide instructions on navigating to the bug or component to help others test it and understand the context.
   - **Checklist** (if applicable): List specific items that developers need to build or fix. This helps track progress by showing what’s been completed and what’s left.
   - **Images, GIFs, or Videos**: Include screenshots, mock-ups, or GIFs when relevant. Visuals can communicate far more efficiently than detailed descriptions and save time.
   - **Relevant Links**: For new features, include any relevant links, such as cross-links to related GitHub issues or pull requests.

4. **Ping Teammates**

   Mention team members (@ + name) to request additional information or bring their attention to an issue.
